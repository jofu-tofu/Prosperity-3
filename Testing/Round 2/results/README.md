# Results Directory for Round 2 Analysis

This directory will contain visualizations and analysis results for Round 2 data.

## Contents

As analysis progresses, this directory will be populated with:

- Visualizations of price and volume data
- Results of strategy performance
- Parameter optimization results
- Comparative analysis between different strategies

## Naming Convention

Files in this directory should follow a consistent naming convention:

- `product_analysis_type.png`: For general visualizations (e.g., `squid_price_analysis.png`)
- `product_strategy_metric.png`: For strategy performance visualizations (e.g., `squid_cmma_returns.png`)
- `product_parameter_optimization.png`: For parameter optimization results (e.g., `squid_lookback_optimization.png`)

## Interpretation

Each visualization should be accompanied by a brief description in the notebook that generated it, explaining:

1. What the visualization shows
2. Key insights or findings
3. Implications for trading strategies
